# Golang CLI Select (with vim key movement)
This is a fork of [gocliselect](https://github.com/Nexidian/gocliselect) with the only difference being that the vim keys are used to go up and down instead of the arrow keys.

**IMPORTANT FOR WHEN USING:** you have to press shift+h/j when moving up and down.
